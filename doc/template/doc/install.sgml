<title>_(Local installation.)_</title>

install clip_dev.tgz  It contains Clip compiler itself, some utils and
standard debugger. For installing this package you need to download it from
ftp server and unpack in convenient directory.)_</para>

environment variable (for example: export CLIPROOT=~/cliproot) and start

means "release"; other keys you can get by ./configure -h).)_</para>

<title>_(Cygwin installation)_</title>

<para>_(Firstly you have need to install a Cygwin package. Better way is taking the
full version from Cygwin main site (cygwin.com).)_ _(But it has a very big size.
Alternative way has taken cygwin_trunc.tgz from ITK's ftp site or from the
mirrors.)_ _(It's truncated version, but this is quite enough for using Clip (even
for building Clip from sources).)_</para>

<para>_(You must unpack cygwin_trunc.tgz in C:\ (root directory of disk C:), unpack
cygwin_patch.tgz to the same place (this file contains some fixes for correct
work), add c:\cygwin\bin in your PATH and add cygwin.reg in your system
registry. After rebooting you can use Cygwin.)_</para>

<para>_(In addition you may install GTK+ packages (gtk_std_win32.rar and
gtkextra_std_win32.rar) if you planing to work with GUI.)_</para>

<title>_(Clip Cygwin binaries)_</title>

current release (clip-prg-&lt;version&gt;.tgz))_</para>
