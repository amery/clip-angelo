<title>_(Possible problems and uncompatibilities)_</title>

<para>_(
One of the most important targets of CLIP is Clipper compatibility.
But when the compatibility gets in contradiction with the functionality,
the latter is chosen as more important. This is the cause of the part of
uncompatibilities. Cause of another part of uncompatibilities is
distinction of the Unix platform (e.g. different file systems
and terminal capabilities).

As a rule, in Unix user should press <emphasis>ESC</emphasis> key twice.
CLIP makes possible to avoid that inconvenience by emulating second
<emphasis>ESC</emphasis> in some interval of keyboard quietness.
The length of that interval is controlled by
<command>SET(_SET_ESC_DELAY,<![CDATA[<nMilliseconds>]]>)</command>.

<listitem><para>_(
<command>SETBLINK()</command> function does not work with CLIP under Unix
(it always returns .T.). When you use <emphasis>BLINK</emphasis>
attribute ('*' in clipper color definition) some terminals display
blinking text others highlight background. Linux console in VGA text mode
blinks, in FB mode highlights background. If you are using text mode console
you can use SVGATextMode program to switch VGA adapter in BG-HI mode
(look at option "16color" in <emphasis>/etc/TextConfig</emphasis>).
If you are using other terminal you have to find a way how to switch them
into proper mode.
)_</para><para>_(
Because it cannot be controlled from server side maybe you will find
interesting this function:
)_</para><programlisting>
blinkattr( [lEnable] ) -> lPrevState
</programlisting><para>_(
which allow to block sending <emphasis>BLINK</emphasis> attribute
from a CLIP application to the terminal. So if you won't be able to
set terminal in BG-HI mode you can disable using
<emphasis>BLINK</emphasis> attribute (<command>blinkattr(.f.)</command>)
and the text won't blink (but their background won't be highlighted too).

<listitem><para>_(
Some RDD functions (e.g. <command>DBSKIP()</command>) don't generate
<emphasis>EG_NOTABLE</emphasis> error when there are no work areas
in use with Clipper 5.01. But with Clipper 5.3 (and Clipper 5.2)
error is generated. In such case CLIP works like Clipper 5.3.

It is impossible to open a table in <command>EXCLUSIVE READONLY</command>
mode with CLIP under Unix. In such case table is opened in
<command>SHARED READONLY</command> mode. The cause is the difference
between DOS's and Unix file locking mechanism.

<emphasis>AS</emphasis> and <emphasis>REF</emphasis> are reserved keywords

<listitem><para>_(
In Clipper, <command>CHR(<![CDATA[<nConst>]]>)</command> is constant (translated
at compile time). In CLIP <command>CHR()</command> is as usual function

<para>_(
CLIP can work in two modes: <emphasis>fullscreen</emphasis> and
<emphasis>stream</emphasis>. Just started, a CLIP application is working
in the <emphasis>stream</emphasis> mode, i.e. all application's output is
placed in the <emphasis>stdout</emphasis> stream. An application
works in this mode until any full screen operation (e.g. displaying a window,
displaying data at a specified screen row and column or polling keyboard)
is performed (this mode is useful for <emphasis>CGI</emphasis> applications,
for example). When any full screen operation is performed, application
initializes terminal, switches to <emphasis>fullscreen</emphasis>
mode and stops output to the <emphasis>stdout</emphasis> stream.

Follow these two simple rules:

<para>_(
stream application (<emphasis>CGI</emphasis>) should redefine the standard
<emphasis>error block</emphasis> (by <command>ERRORBLOCK()</command>
function) to avoid turning into <emphasis>fullscreen</emphasis> mode
(standard <emphasis>error block</emphasis> performs full screen operations).
For example:
)_</para>
<programlisting>
errorblock({|err| myerr(err)})
function myerr(err)
	outerr("Error:",err) // outerr() outputs to the stderr
	exit
return

In the Unix file system, file mask <emphasis>*.*</emphasis> means all files
with a dot ('.') in their names. Use the <emphasis>FILE_MASK</emphasis>
macro instead of '<emphasis>*.*</emphasis>'. <emphasis>FILE_MASK</emphasis>
is platform dependent constant ('<emphasis>*</emphasis>' in Unix,
'<emphasis>*.*</emphasis>' in Windows).

With Clipper, the <command>TYPE()</command> function invokes some functions
(e.g. <command>SUBSTR()</command>) and does not invoke anothers
(e.g. <command>ALERT()</command>). CLIP does not invoke any function

function calls.

Clipper have an odd feature:

Unix file system does differentiate the case of letters in the file names
(<command>USE table.dbf</command> and <command>USE TABLE.DBF</command>
are not equivalent commands). To help porting DOS-applications to Unix
<command>SET TRANSLATE PATH ON</command> command is intended.
When <command>ON</command> all file (and directory) names are translated
to the lower case. In this case the full path to the file and the file itself
<emphasis>must</emphasis> be in the lower case on the disk.
When <command>OFF</command> the translation is not performed. In this case
names of the files on the disk must correspond to the names they are
addressed by.

You should recollect <command>DISPBEGIN()</command>,
<command>DISPEND()</command> functions. Those who have
long been working with terminals must understand well why it is
necessary. As for novices, they should read attentively the description
of these functions and imagine how information runs via narrow
commiunication channels from the server to terminals and how the
processor is loaded, while outputting information. To use them is not
necessary, but it's desirable, particularly in those places where you
display and process the input from the keyboard themselves. In those
functions and commands (<command>PROMPT/MENU</command>,
<command>GET/READ</command>, etc) where the processing
of the display and keyboard is executed independently, an optimal output
mode has been already used, and so enclosing them by
<command>DISPBEGIN()</command> and <command>DISPEND()</command>
is unnecessary.

The restriction of the function/procedure name size of 10 chars has
been removed. It applies equally to variable names. To simplify the
transition to a length of more than 10 symbols, you can use
<command>#xdefine</command> directive (case-insensitive
<command>#define</command>).

<command>RUN</command> command output damages current screen contents.
When outputting to the terminal, this problem cannot be completely solved
without resorting to tricks, as it turns out that several programs output
independently to one device, in the same way as if several programs,
independent of each other, output information to one COM port. We recommend
to use something like:
)_</para><programlisting>
run <![CDATA[&command]]>
wait "Press any key"
clear screen // or restore screen
</programlisting><para>_(
And one more peculiarity of the <command>RUN</command> command - in Unux,
it runs the shell, then shell executes the program. Though
<command>run cd mydir</command> will operate, but after exiting from the shell
the current directory will remain the same.

It is preferable to use <command>inkey(0.1)</command> instead of
