"The basic currency of SGML is the\n"
"<firstterm>tag</firstterm>.  A simple tag consists of a\n"
"pair of angle brackets and the name of the tag.  For\n"
"example, the <sgmltag>para</sgmltag> tag would appear in\n"
"an SGML document as <sgmltag\n"
"class=\"starttag\">para</sgmltag>.  This start tag indicates\n"
"that the immediately following text should be classified\n"
"according to the tag.  In regular SGML, each opening tag\n"
"must have a matching end tag to show where the start tag's\n"
"contents end.  End tags begin with\n"
"<quote><literal>&lt;/</literal></quote> markup, e.g.,\n"
"<sgmltag class=\"endtag\">para</sgmltag>."

"The <acronym>XML</acronym> (<firstterm>eXtensible Markup\n"
"Language</firstterm>) specification, a modern subset of\n"

"content.  The entire element is a single tag, ending with\n"
"<quote><literal>/&gt;</literal></quote>, e.g.,\n"
"<sgmltag>&lt;xref/&gt;</sgmltag>.  However, use of this\n"

"DocBook is giving specific elements a name, or an ID, so\n"
"you can refer to it from elsewhere.  This ID can be used\n"
