$FUNCNAME$
  TRIM()
$CATEGORY$
  STRING
$SUMMARY$
   Remove trailing spaces from a character string
$SYNTAX$
     TRIM(<cString>) --> cTrimString
$ARGUMENTS$
     <cString> is the character string to be copied without trailing
     spaces.
$RETURNS$
     TRIM() returns a copy of <cString> with the trailing spaces removed.  If
     <cString> is a null string ("") or all spaces, TRIM() returns a null
     string ("").
$DESCRIPTION$
     TRIM() is a character function that formats character strings.  It is
     useful when you want to delete trailing spaces while concatenating
     strings.  This is typically the case with database fields which are
     stored in fixed-width format.  For example, you can use TRIM() to
     concatenate first and last name fields to form a name string.

     TRIM() is related to LTRIM(), which removes leading spaces, and
     ALLTRIM(), which removes both leading and trailing spaces.  The inverse
     of ALLTRIM(), LTRIM(), and RTRIM() are the PADC(), PADR(), and PADL()
     functions which center, right-justify, or left-justify character strings
     by padding them with fill characters.
$EXAMPLES$

       This is a user-defined function in which TRIM() formats city,
	state, and zip code fields for labels or form letters:

	FUNCTION CityState(cCity, cState, cZip)
	   RETURN TRIM(cCity) + ", " ;
	    + TRIM(cState) + "  " + cZip

       In this example the user-defined function, CityState(),
	displays a record from Customer.dbf:

	USE Customer INDEX CustName NEW
	SEEK "Kate"

	? CityState(City, State, ZipCode)
	// Result: Athens, GA 10066
