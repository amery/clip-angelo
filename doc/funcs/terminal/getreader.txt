$DESCRIPTION$
     GETREADER() is a GET function that implements the standard READ behavior
     for GETs.  By default, READMODAL() uses the GETREADER() function to read
     Get objects.  GETREADER() in turn uses other functions in Getsys.prg to
     do the work of reading the Get object.
$EXAMPLES$
       This example sets the current Get object to the first GET in
	the Get list.  Then, a READ is performed on this GET which has no
	menu object, but includes a message bar at row 25 from column 0 to
	column 80.  The color of the text on the message bar is white with a
	red background.

	oGet := GetList [1]
	GETREADER (oGet, Getlist, NIL,25,;
		       0,80,"W+/R")
