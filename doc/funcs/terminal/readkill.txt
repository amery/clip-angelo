$FUNCNAME$
  READKILL()
$CATEGORY$
  TERMINAL/IO
$SUMMARY$
   Return, and optionally set, whether the current READ should be exited
$SYNTAX$
     READKILL([<lKillRead>]) --> lCurrentSetting
$ARGUMENTS$
     <lKillRead> sets the READKILL() flag.  A value of true (.T.)
     indicates that the current read should be terminated, and a value of
     false (.F.) indicates that it should not.
$RETURNS$
     READKILL() returns the current setting as a logical value.
$DESCRIPTION$
     READKILL() is a Get system function that lets you control whether or not
     to terminate the current READ.

     Unless directly manipulated, READKILL() returns true (.T.) after you
     issue a CLEAR GETS (see the CLEAR GETS entry ) for the current READ;
     otherwise, it returns false (.F.).

     By accessing the function directly, however, you can control the
     READKILL() flag with its function argument and use it to create new READ
     layers.
