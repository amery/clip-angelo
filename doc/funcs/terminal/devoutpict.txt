$CATEGORY$
  TERMINAL/IO
$SUMMARY$
   Write a value to the current device using a picture clause
$SYNTAX$
     DEVOUTPICT(<exp>, <cPicture>, [<cColorString>]) --> NIL
$ARGUMENTS$
     <exp> is the value to display.

     <cPicture> defines the formatting control for the display of <exp>.
     The picture specified here is the same as one used with @...SAY or
     TRANSFORM and can include both templates and functions.

     <cColorString> is an optional argument that defines the display
     color of <exp>.  If the current DEVICE is SCREEN, output displays in the
     specified color.

     If not specified, <exp> displays as the standard color of the current
     system color as defined by SETCOLOR().  <cColorString> is a character
     expression containing the standard color setting.  If you want to
     specify a literal color setting, it must be enclosed in quote marks.
$RETURNS$
     DEVOUTPICT() always returns NIL.
$DESCRIPTION$
     DEVOUTPICT() is a full-screen display function that writes the value of
     a single expression to the current device at the current cursor or
     printhead position.  DEVOUTPICT() is used in combination with DEVPOS()
     in Std.ch to implement the @...SAY command used with a PICTURE clause.
$EXAMPLES$
       This example shows the relationship between the DEVOUTPICT()
	function and the @...SAY command:

	DEVPOS(10, 10)
	DEVOUTPICT("Hello there", "@!", "BG+/B"))
	//
	@ 10, 10 SAY "Hello there" PICTURE "@!" COLOR "BG+/B"
