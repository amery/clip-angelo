$SYNTAX$
     READUPDATED([<lChanged>]) --> lCurrentSetting
$ARGUMENTS$
     <lChanged> sets the READUPDATED() flag.  A value of true (.T.)
     indicates that data has changed, and a value of false (.F.) indicates
     that no change has occurred.
$RETURNS$
     READUPDATED() returns the current setting as a logical value.
$DESCRIPTION$
     READUPDATED() is a Get system function intended primarily for creating
     new READ Layers.  It is identical in functionality to UPDATED() (see the
     UPDATED() entry ), except that it allows the UPDATED() flag to be set.

     READUPDATED() enables you to manipulate the UPDATED() flag from outside
     of the Get system's source code.
