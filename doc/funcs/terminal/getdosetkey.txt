$SUMMARY$
   Process SET KEY during GET editing
$SYNTAX$
     GETDOSETKEY(<bKeyBlock>, <oGet>) --> NIL
$ARGUMENTS$
     <oGet> is a reference to the current Get object.
     <bKeyBlock> is the code block to execute.
$RETURNS$
     GETDOSETKEY() always returns NIL.
$DESCRIPTION$
     GETDOSETKEY() is a function that executes a SET KEY code block,
     preserving the context of the passed Get object.

     Note that the procedure name and line number passed to the SET KEY block
     are based on the most recent call to READMODAL().
$EXAMPLES$
       The following example determines if the last key pressed,
	nKey, has a SET KEY associated with it.  If it does, then GETDOSETKEY
	is called to execute that block on the current GET.

	IF ((bKeyBlock := SETKEY (nKey)) == NIL)
	   GETDOSETKEY (bKeyBlock, oGet)
	ENDIF
