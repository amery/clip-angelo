$FUNCNAME$
   FT_SCANCODE()
$CATEGORY$
   Keyboard/Mouse
$ONELINER$
   Wait for keypress and return keyboard scan code
$SYNTAX$
   FT_SCANCODE() --> cCode
$ARGUMENTS$
   None
$RETURNS$
   A two-character string, corresponding to the keyboard scan code.
$DESCRIPTION$
   FT_SCANCODE() enables you to distinguish the different scancodes
   of similar keys (such as Grey minus versus regular minus), thus
   increasing the number of keys your input routine can recognize.

   It works like INKEY(), in that it waits for a key to be pressed.
   The scan code consists of two bytes, which are returned as a
   two-character string.

   For example, calling FT_SCANCODE() and pressing the Grey-minus
   key will return a two character string:

	  CHR(45) + CHR(74)

   LASTKEY() is not updated by FT_SCANCODE(), so don't try to
   test LASTKEY() to see what was pressed during an FT_SCANCODE()
   call.  Simply assign the return value to a variable and test
   that (see the test driver below).

   *  This was adapted from a short C routine posted by John Kaster on
      NANFORUM.  It was written in Clipper to help demonstrate the
      FT_INT86 function of the Nanforum Toolkit.

   This program requires FT_INT86().
$EXAMPLES$
      cKey := FT_SCANCODE()

    [grey-] returns:  CHR(45) + CHR(74)
    [-]     returns:  CHR(45) + CHR(12)
    [grey+] returns:  CHR(43) + CHR(78)
    [+]     returns:  CHR(43) + CHR(13)
