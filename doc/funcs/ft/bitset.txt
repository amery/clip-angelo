$FUNCNAME$
   FT_BITSET()
$CATEGORY$
   String
$ONELINER$
   Set selected bit in a byte
$SYNTAX$
   FT_BITSET( <cByte>, <nBitPos> ) --> cByte
$ARGUMENTS$
   <cByte> is a character from CHR(0) to CHR(255).

   <nBitPos> is a number from 0 to 7 conforming to standard right-to-left
   bit numbering convention and representing the position of the bit
   within the byte.
$RETURNS$
   Returns new byte, with designated bit set.  If parameters are faulty,
   returns NIL.
$DESCRIPTION$
   In effect, ORs argument byte with a byte that has only the target bit
   set.  If bit is already set, it remains set.
   Note: Calls FT_ISBIT() which is also in this Library.

   This function is presented to illustrate that bit-wise operations
   are possible with Clipper code.  For greater speed, write .C or
   .ASM versions and use the Clipper Extend system.
$EXAMPLES$
   This code would set bit 4 in a byte represented by CHR(107):

	cNewbyte := FT_BITSET( CHR(107), 4 )
	? ASC( cNewbyte )             // result: 123
	? cNewbyte                    // result: '{'


   This code would set bit 5 in the byte represented by the letter 'A'.

	? FT_BITSET( 'A', 5 )         // result: 'a'
				      // bit 5 set

   For a demonstration of Clipper bit manipulations, compile and
   link the program BITTEST.PRG in the Nanforum Toolkit source code.
