   Return accounting quarter data
$SYNTAX$
   FT_ACCTQTR( [ <dGivenDate> ], [ <nQtrNum> ] ) --> aDateinfo
$ARGUMENTS$
   <dGivenDate> is any valid date in any date format.  Defaults
   to current system date if not supplied.

   <nQtrNum> is a number from 1 to 4 signifying a quarter.
   Defaults to current quarter if not supplied.
$RETURNS$
   A three element array containing the following data:

      aDateInfo[1] - The year and qtr. as a character string "YYYYQQ"
      aDateInfo[2] - The beginning date of the accounting quarter
      aDateInfo[3] - The ending date of the accounting quarter
$DESCRIPTION$
   FT_ACCTQTR() creates an array containing data about the
   accounting quarter containing the given date.

   An accounting period has the following characteristics:

   If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
   days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
   week was included in the prior period.

   If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
   days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
   is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
   'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
   'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
   weeks.
$EXAMPLES$
   // get info about accounting month containing 9/15/90
   aDateInfo := FT_ACCTQTR( CTOD("09/15/90") )
   ? aDateInfo[1]   //  199003       (3rd quarter)
   ? aDateInfo[2]   //  07/01/90     beginning of quarter 3
   ? aDateInfo[3]   //  09/29/90     end of quarter 3

   // get info about accounting qtr. 2 in year containing 9/15/90
   aDateInfo := FT_ACCTQTR( CTOD("09/15/90"), 2 )
   ? aDateInfo[1]   //  199002
   ? aDateInfo[2]   //  04/01/89   beginning of quarter 2
   ? aDateInfo[3]   //  06/30/90   end of quarter 2
