$DESCRIPTION$
    PopAdder() gives you an adding machine inside your Clipper 5.2
    application. It has the basic functions add, subtract, multiply,
    and divide. You may move it from one side of the screen to the
    other. It even displays a scrollable tape, if you want it.


    There are a few HOT Keys while using the Adder:

	   <D>ecimals € change # of decimals
	   <M>ove     € the Adder from right display to left
	   <T>ape     € turn the Tape Display On or Off
	   <S>croll   € the tape display
	   <DEL> €€€ˆ€€ 1st Clear entry
		    „€€ 2nd Clear ADDER
	   <ESC>      € Quit
	   <F10>      € return a <TOTAL> to the active get


    A couple of notes about the adder:


    1.) It was designed to be used on an Enhanced keyboard with
	separate <DELETE> key. <DELETE> is used to clear the adder.
	However, it will still work on a Standard keyboard.

    2.) You do not have to display the tape. You may turn it on
	at any time by pressing <T>. You may SCROLL back through
	the tape once there are more than 16 entries in the
	adder, by pressing <S>.

    3.) To Quit the Adder just press <ESC>. To return your Total
	to the application press <F10>. The adder will place the
	Total in the active GET variable using oGet:VarPut(). The
	adder will only return a Total to a numerical GET!

    4.) There are many support functions that you might find
	interesting. They are part of my personal library, but
	are necessary to the operation of the adder.
	You might want to pull these out to reduce the overall
	size of the adder. Many are worth at least a little
	time studying.

    5.) To make FT_Adder a Hot key from inside your application
	at the beginning of your application add the line:

	       SET KEY K_ALT_A  TO FT_Adder

	This will make <ALT-A> a key "Hot" and permit you to
	Pop - Up the adder from anywhere in the application.

    6.) If you use FT_INKEY(), you can even have active hotkeys
	in an INKEY().
