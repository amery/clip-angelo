$CATEGORY$
   Date/Time
$ONELINER$
   Return accounting year data
$SYNTAX$
   FT_ACCTYEAR( [ <dGivenDate> ] ) --> aDateInfo
$ARGUMENTS$
   <dGivenDate> is any valid date in any date format.  Defaults
   to current system date if not supplied.
$RETURNS$
   A three element array containing the following data:

      aDateInfo[1] - The year as a character string "YYYY"
      aDateInfo[2] - The beginning date of the accounting year
      aDateInfo[3] - The ending date of the accounting year
$DESCRIPTION$
   FT_ACCTYEAR() creates an array containing data about the
   accounting year containing the given date.

   An accounting period has the following characteristics:

   If the first week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
   days, it is included in the period; otherwise, the first
   week was included in the prior period.

   If the last week of the period contains 4 or more 'work'
   days it is included in the period; otherwise, the last week
   is included in the next period.  This results in 13 week
   'quarters' and 4 or 5 week 'months'.  Every 5 or 6 years, a
   'quarter' will contain 14 weeks and the year will contain 53
   weeks.
$EXAMPLES$
   // get info about accounting year containing 9/15/90
   aDateInfo := FT_ACCTYEAR( CTOD("09/15/90") )
   ? aDateInfo[1]   //  1990
   ? aDateInfo[2]   //  12/31/89    beginning of year
   ? aDateInfo[3]   //  12/29/90    end of year
