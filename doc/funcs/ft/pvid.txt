$FUNCNAME$
   FT_PUSHVID()
$CATEGORY$
   Video
$ONELINER$
   Save current video states on internal stack.
$SYNTAX$
   FT_PushVid() --> <nStackSize>
$ARGUMENTS$
   None
$RETURNS$
   The current size of the internal stack (i.e. the number of times
   FT_PushVid() has been called).
$DESCRIPTION$
   Menus, picklists, browses, and other video-intensive items often
   require you to save certain video states -- screen image, cursor
   position, and so forth.  Constantly saving and restoring these items
   can get very tedious.  This function attempts to alleviate this
   problem.  When called, it saves the cursor position, color setting,
   screen image, cursor style, blink setting, scoreboard setting, snow
   setting, and maximum row and column to a series of static arrays.  All
   that is needed to restore the saved settings is a call to FT_PopVid().
$EXAMPLES$

$FUNCNAME$
   FT_POPVID()
$CATEGORY$
   Video
$ONELINER$
   Restore previously saved video states.
$SYNTAX$
   FT_PopVid() --> <nStackSize>
$ARGUMENTS$
   None
$RETURNS$
   The number of items remaining in the internal stack.
$DESCRIPTION$
   This is the complementary function to FT_PushVid().  At some time
   after saving the video states it will probably be necessary to restore
   them.  This is done by restoring the settings from the last call to
   FT_PushVid().  The number of items on the internal stack is then
   reduced by one.  Note that the use of stack logic means that items on
   the stack are retrieved in Last In First Out order.
