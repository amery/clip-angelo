$FUNCNAME$
   FT_LINKED()
$CATEGORY$
   Environment
$ONELINER$
   Determine if a function was linked in
$SYNTAX$
   FT_LINKED( <cString> ) --> lResult
$ARGUMENTS$
   <cString> is a character string containing one or more function
	     calls
$RETURNS$
   .T. if all functions within the string are currently linked into
   the application, .F. if one or more aren't.  See below for a
   definition of "function."
$DESCRIPTION$

   This function would be used in data driven application to determine
   whether or not a macro compiled function was linked in.

   Several functions can be passed, and nested, in <cString>.

   Caveat: Some function calls are converted by the preprocessor
   into other function calls. You cannot have these types of
   functions in a macro compiled string as they never exist at
   runtime. FT_LINKED will correctly tell you that they are invalid.

   For instance: there is no function called SORT() in any of the
   Nantucket LIBraries, but it is a valid CLIPPER command because the
   preprocessor will convert it to other function calls.


$EXAMPLES$

   cString := "FT_GoodFunc(BadFunc(3,2))"
   IF FT_LINKED(cString)
      EVAL( &("{||"+cString+"}") )
   ELSE
      ALERT("Error: "+cString+" was not linked in. Called by FT_LINKED()")
   ENDIF
