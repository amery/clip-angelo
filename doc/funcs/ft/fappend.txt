$CATEGORY$

$ONELINER$
   Appends a line to the currently selected text file
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FAPPEND( [ < nLines > ] ) --> NIL

$ARGUMENTS$

   <nLines> is the number of lines that should be appended to the
   end of the currently selected text file.

   If <nLines> is omitted, one record is appended.

$RETURNS$

   lSuccess.  If FALSE, check ^bft_fError()^n for the error code.

$DESCRIPTION$

   This function appends a line of text to the file in the currently
   selected text file workarea.  Text lines are delimited with a
   CRLF pair.  The record pointer is moved to the last appended
   record.

   Multiple lines may be appended with one call to FT_FAPPEND().

   A text file "record" is a line of text terminated by a CRLF pair.
   Each line appended with this function will be empty.

   NOTE:  Occasionally a text file may contain a non-CRLF terminated
   line, at the end of the file ("stragglers").  This function assumes
   these stragglers to be the last line of the file, and begins
   appending the new lines after this line.  In other words, if the
   last line in the text file is not terminated with a CRLF pair prior
   to calling FT_FAPPEND(), the function will terminate that last line
   before appending any new lines.

$EXAMPLES$

   // add a blank line of text to a file
   FT_FUSE( "test.txt" )

   ?FT_FRECNO()           // displays 5

   FT_FAPPEND()

   ?FT_FRECNO()           // displays 6
