$CATEGORY$
   File I/O
$ONELINER$
   Move record pointer to specific record in a text file
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FGOTO( nLine ) --> NIL

$ARGUMENTS$

   <nLine> is the record number to go to.

$RETURNS$

   NIL

$DESCRIPTION$

   This function moves the record pointer to a specific record
   in the file in the currently selected text file workarea.  If
   the record number requested is greater than the number of records
   in the file, the record pointer will be positioned at the last
   record.

   Internally, the function operates differently depending on how
   you invoke it.  Passing a value for ^b<nLine>^n results in what
   is effectively a skip operation, which is fairly quick.  However
   if you pass 0 for ^b<nLine>^n, e.g. ft_fGoTo( 0 ), the function
   internally goes to the top of the file, then skips down the
   required number of records.  Hence if your file is relatively
   large and the current record is a high number, you may see some
   delay as ft_fGoTo(0) skips through the file.

   A text file "record" is a line of text terminated by a CRLF pair.

$EXAMPLES$

   // read 5th line of text from file

   ft_fUse( "FTTEXT.C" )

   ft_fGoTo(5)

   cText := ft_fReadLN()
