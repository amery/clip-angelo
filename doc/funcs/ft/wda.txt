$FUNCNAME$
   FT_ADDWKDY()
$CATEGORY$
   Date/Time
$ONELINER$
   Return true number of days to add given number of workdays
$SYNTAX$
   FT_ADDWKDY( <dStart>, <nWorkDays> ) --> nTrueDays
$ARGUMENTS$
   <dStart> = date to start adding from
   <nWorkDays> = number of workdays to add
$RETURNS$
   <nTrueDays> = Number of actual days to add to <dStart> in
		 order to add the required <nWorkDays>
$DESCRIPTION$
    Let's say you are given the problem:

       "All invoices are due 10 working days from the date they
       are printed.  Please display the due date on the invoice."

    When is the due date?  Assuming you are printing the invoices
    today, your answer is:

	 dDueDate := DATE() + ft_addWkDay( DATE(), 10 )

    A work day is defined as Monday through Friday.  Unfortunately
    this routine does _not_ account for holidays.

    This documentation was written by Glenn Scott so if it's wrong,
    blame him.

$EXAMPLES$
    // Postdate 5 working days from the first of January
    dPost := CTOD("01/01/91")
    dPost += FT_ADDWKDY( dPost, 5 )   // returns 7 true days
    ? dPost                          //  01/08/91
