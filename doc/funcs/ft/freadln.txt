$FUNCNAME$
   FT_FREADLN()
$CATEGORY$
   File I/O
$ONELINER$
   Read a line from the currently selected text file
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FREADLN() --> cLine

$ARGUMENTS$

   None

$RETURNS$

   A string containing the current record in a text file.

$DESCRIPTION$

   This function returns a line of text read from the file in the
   currently selected text file workarea.  Text lines are delimited
   with a CRLF pair.  The record pointer is not moved.

   Currently the maximum record size is 4096 characters.  You may
   increase the maximum record size by changing the value of ^b#define
   ^bBUFFSIZE^n in the C source and recompiling, however you should
   consider the performance implications if you do (all read and writes
   use this buffer size, including ft_fSkip()'s and ft_fGoto()'s).

   If a read error occurs ^ft_fError()^n will contain the error code.

   A text file "record" is a line of text terminated by a CRLF pair.

$EXAMPLES$

   // display each record of a text file

   FT_FUSE( "text.c" )

   DO WHILE ! FT_FEOF()

      ? FT_FREADLN()

      FT_FSKIP()
