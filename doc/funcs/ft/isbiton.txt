$FUNCNAME$
   FT_ISBITON()
$CATEGORY$
   String
$ONELINER$
   Determine the state of individual bits in a number
$SYNTAX$
   FT_ISBITON( <nNumber>, <nBit> ) --> lResult
$ARGUMENTS$
   <nNumber> is an integer for which a bit state needs to be checked.

   <nBit> is a number from 0 to 15 that indicates which bit to test.
$RETURNS$
   .T. if the specified bit was on., .F. if off.
$DESCRIPTION$
   This function is useful when dealing with binary integers.  It will
   come in very handy if you use the FT_INT86() function, because the
   CPU flags are returned as a series of bits.  Using this function, you
   can determine the state of each CPU flag.
$EXAMPLES$
   if FT_ISBITON( nCPUFlags, 0 )
      Qout( "The carry flag was set." )
   endif

   if FT_ISBITON( nCPUFlags, 7 )
      Qout( "The sign flag was set." )
   endif
