$CATEGORY$

$ONELINER$
   Select a text file workarea
$SYNTAX$

   FT_FSELECT( [ <nNewArea> ] ) --> nPreviousArea

$ARGUMENTS$

   ^b<nNewArea>^n is the text file workarea to select.

$RETURNS$

   The current selected text file area.

$DESCRIPTION$

   This function selects a text file "workarea" from 1 to 10.  A
   file may or may not be open in the selected area.

   Passing 0 for ^b<nNewArea>^n selects the next available workarea,
   similar to Clipper's SELECT 0 command.  If no more workareas are
   available the current workarea is not changed.

   Each file is opened in its own "workarea", similar to the concept
   used by dbf files.  As provided, a maximum of 10 files (in 10
   workareas) can be opened (assuming there are sufficient file
   handles available).  That number may be increased by modifying
   the #define TEXT_WORKAREAS in the C source code and recompiling.

   All the FT_F*() file functions operate on the file in the currently
   selected text file workarea.

   Text file workareas are separate from and independent of Clipper's
   database workareas.

$EXAMPLES$

   FT_FSELECT(1)

   nFile1 := FT_FUSE( "temp.c" )

   ? FT_FLASTRE()                 // no. of lines in temp.c

   FT_FSELECT(2)

   nFile2 := FT_FUSE( "temp.h" )

   ? FT_FLASTRE()                 // no. of lines in temp.h
