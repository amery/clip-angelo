   Add orders to the order list
$SYNTAX$
     ORDLISTADD(<cOrderBagName> [, <cOrderName>]) --> NIL
$ARGUMENTS$
     <cOrderBagName> is the name of a disk file containing one or more
     orders.  You may specify <cOrderBagName> as the file name with or
     without the path name or appropriate extension.  If you do not include
     the extension as part of <cOrderBagName>, xClipper uses the default
     extension of the current RDD.

     <cOrderName> the name of the specific order from the order bag to be
     added to the order list of the current work area.  If you do not specify
     <cOrderName>, all orders in the order bag are added to the order list of
     the current work area.
$RETURNS$
     ORDLISTADD() always returns NIL.
$DESCRIPTION$
     ORDLISTADD() is an order management function that adds the contents of
     an order bag, or a single order in an order bag, to the order list.
     This function lets you extend the order list without issuing a SET INDEX
     command that, first, clears all the active orders from the order list.

     Any orders already associated with the work area continue to be active.
     If the newly opened order bag contains the only order associated with
     the work area, it becomes the controlling order; otherwise, the
     controlling order remains unchanged.

     After the new orders are opened, the work area is positioned to the
     first logical record in the controlling order.

     ORDLISTADD() is similar to the SET INDEX command or the INDEX clause of
     the USE command, except that it does not clear the order list prior to
     adding the new order(s).

     ORDLISTADD() supersedes the DBSETINDEX() function.

     The active RDD determines the order capacity of an order bag.  The
     default  DBFNTX and the DBFNDX drivers only support single-order bags,
     while other RDDs may support multiple-order bags (e.g., the DBFCDX
     driver).  When using RDDs that support multiple-order bags, you must
     explicitly SET ORDER (or ORDSETFOCUS()) to the desired controlling
     order.  If you do not specify a controlling order, the data file will be
     viewed in first order.
