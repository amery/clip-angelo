This is a source tree for standard (prg) clip packages.

For local installation (binaries linked into $HOME/bin,
CLIPROOT defaults to ../cliproot, shared libraries with full path
in executable), just type

./make local

from user console. Note that $HOME/bin must be in your PATH environment
variable for easy launch of CLIP binaries.


For system-wide installation (binaries linked into /usr/local/bin,
CLIPROOT defaults to /usr/local/clip, shared libraries without
path in executable and are linked into /usr/lib), type

./make system

from root console.

It is possible set CLIPROOT from command line like this:

./make system CLIPROOT=/usr/local/opt/clip

or set CLIPROOT as environment variable.


You can compile system-wide packages in some packager format as:

./make deb  - for Debian package
./make rpm  - for RPM package
./make tgz  - for system without package manager (or unknown)
./make tbz  - the same as tgz, but archives are in tar.bz2 format

Destination directory for this targets is
../clip_distrib/VERSION/TARGET-ARCHITECTURE-LIBCVERSION

Created packages are:
clip-lib	- base (standard) runtime library
clip-dev	- development package (compiler)
clip-prg	- development utilities
clip-gtk	- GTK GUI support library
clip-gzip	- zlib interface library
clip-bzip2	- bzip2 interface library
clip-gd		- GD image plot graphtics interface library
clip-mysql	- mysql interface library
clip-postgres	- postgres interface library
clip-oracle	- oracle interface library
