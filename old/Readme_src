This is a source tree for standard (prg) clip packages.

For local installation (binaries linked into $HOME/bin,
CLIPROOT defaults to ../cliproot, shared libraries with full path
in executable), just type

./local.sh 
./home               to $HOME/clipXX


from user console. Note that $HOME/bin must be in your PATH environment
variable for easy launch of CLIP binaries.


For system-wide installation (binaries linked into /root/bin,
CLIPROOT defaults to /usr/local/clip, shared libraries without
path in executable , type

./usr.local.sh for /usr.local/clipXX install

or

./opt.sh for /opt/clipXX install

from root console.

Then from user console type :

./linkall.sh

to link them into $HOME/bin



You can compile system-wide packages in some packager format as:

./make deb  - for Debian package
./make rpm  - for RPM package
./make tgz  - for system without package manager (or unknown)
./make tbz  - the same as tgz, but archives are in tar.bz2 format

Destination directory for this targets is
../clip_distrib/VERSION/TARGET-ARCHITECTURE-LIBCVERSION

Created packages are:
clip-lib	- base (standard) runtime library
clip-dev	- development package (compiler)
clip-prg	- development utilities
clip-gtk	- GTK GUI support library
clip-gzip	- zlib interface library
clip-bzip2	- bzip2 interface library
clip-gd		- GD image plot graphtics interface library
clip-mysql	- mysql interface library
clip-postgres	- postgres interface library
clip-oracle	- oracle interface library
