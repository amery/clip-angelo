 *     fn_NameL( cName, nRequiredLength)  => cReturn
 *
 *  $ARGUMENTS$
 *
 *     <cName>	 - the character string to be used (shouldn't be longer
 *                  than 255 characters
 *     <nLength> -  if specified, the String is padded with NULLs
 *		            to this length
 *
 *  $RETURNS$
 *
 *     <cReturn> - a character string with a one byte word at the beginning
 *	  which indicates the string length, including a null terminator
 *	  which is added if it does not exist.
 *
 *  $DESCRIPTION$
 *
 *     There are numerous places where a character string that is sent
 *     needs to be encoded with a leading BYTE specifying the length
 *     and may also need to be padded with NULLs.
 *
 *     A terminating null is guaranteed.
 *
 *     If the Length of cName is greater than nRequiredLength -1,
 *     it is truncated to leave room for the terminator.
 *
 *  $EXAMPLES$
