The installation is currently <EM>hard wired</EM>. There is no support for the
GNU auto-tools (automake or autoconf). The whole `configuration' is done by the
user. You have to edit <TT>ezV24_conf.h</TT>. For the moment, that's all.

<P>To compile and install the libary, just unpack the archive (you may have done
this ;) and execute the following steps:

<P><OL> 

<P><LI> compile the library by typing `make'. The result should be a executable
shared library named `libezV24.so.*'.

<P><PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make
&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>

<P><LI> become root and install the library and the header files. This call
will update you ldd-cache too! Note that this doen's install the html
documentation! I'm not shure where to install it, so you can put it into your
prefered directory.

<P><PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;su
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;install
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit
&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>

<P><LI> Now you have the `ezV24'-library installed. The last (optional) step is
to compile the sample program.

<P><PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;test-v24
&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The result is a small executable <TT>test-v24</TT>. To see what <TT>test-v24</TT> do, you
must have a look into the source code.

<P></OL>
