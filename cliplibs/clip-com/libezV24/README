----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first full featured release of the `ezV24' library. The goal of
this libary is to provide a easy to use interface to the serial ports of the
linux system. This release comes with rudimentary support for the CYGWIN
toolchain (see http://www.cygwin.com/). Due to the great work of the cygwin
folks, only minimal changes are needed. I know that that the cygwin-stuff
isn't the final stuff, but it's a first step and it works.


HOME ON THE NET
---------------

The project it hosted at sourceforge. You can find the latest release of the
`ezV24' library at http://libezV24.sourceforge.net/. If you have some
questions, feel free to write me an email <jdesch@users.sourceforge.net>. To
ease the mail handling, please put a [ezV24] into the subject line of the
mail.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install the libary, just unpack the archive (you may have done this ;) and
execute the following steps:

(1) compile the library by typing `make'. The result should be a executable
    shared library named `libezV24.so.*'.

    $ make

(2) become root and install the library and the header files. This call will
    update you ldd-cache too! Note that this doen's install the html
    documentation! I'm not shure where to install it, so you can put it into 
    your prefered directory.

    > su
    > make install
    > exit

    Some systems don't use /usr/local/lib as possible path for libraries. In
    this case, you should add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf before
    calling `make install'!


(3) Now you have the `ezV24'-library installed. The last (optional) step is
    to compile the sample program.

    $ make test-v24

    The result is a small executable `test-v24'. To see what `test-v24' do,
    you must have a look into the source code.


UPDATE
------

Previous releases of `ezV24' have installed the unnecessary header
ezV24_conf.h. If you update to V0.1.0, you should either call the old
Makefile with `make uninstall' or remove the file manually.


USAGE
-----

To use the libary for your own applications, you have to include the main
header:

	#include <ezV24/ezV24.h>

To link the shared library to your application, you just have to specify the
basename of the library with `-lezV24'. The whole call could look like this:

	gcc -o foo foo.c -lezV24

For more information, just have a look into the html documentation.
