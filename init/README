Preamble
--------

Original files, authors and Copyright do not appear because of
semi-automatic generation of files.

I DO NOT WANT TO CLAIM ALL THE PRIVILEGES AS AUTHOR.

I declare that the original "fathers" of the files are
the development team of clip.


Feelings
--------

The adaptation of the files is made to have a better perfomance
while compiling and developping.

It can be a better way but I do what I can.

I try to make uniform 'Makefile' for easier maintenance and update.

I hope that my way of feeling the packages is a good one.

ANY SUGGESTION IS WELCOME.


Structure of Makefile
---------------------

	Main definitions in Makefile.inc by configure.gen.sh
	
	Makefile
		./subdir/
			Makefile relies on ../Makefile & ./subsubdir ...
			

Structure of configure.gen.sh
-----------------------------


	$ Function declarations;
		
		Service & repeated routines;
	
	$ Directory section for configure;
		
		e.g. : subdir cliplibs/clip-gd
					graphic libraries...
					checking & configure
	
	$ Main configure
	
		Generation of global settings, Makefile.inc, scripts...
		
				
IMPORTANT:
----------

	Subdirectory clip/codb moved to cliplibs/clip-codb.
