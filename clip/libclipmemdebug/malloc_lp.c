/*
 * If anyone can think of a better way to do this *please* let me know.
 *
 * The goal is to allow people to use the debug library during development
 * and then disable and return to the system (or more efficient) malloc
 * functions by just relinking with another library.
 *
 * The problem is that we want to provide the library with file/line
 * information with each call.  Backtracing the stack-frame is neither
 * portable or necessarily easy so the cpp __FILE__ and __LINE__ directives
 * are used instead.  But how to pass this information to the library is
 * the challange.  How can we do this in a graceful and sane manner while
 * still providing the "quick-release" functionality above?
 *
 * I have decided on this leap-frog file that will have to *always* be
 * compiled in.  It will have the special _malloc_file and _malloc_line
 * variables and will set them whether malloc-debug routines are linked
 * in to use them or not.
 *
 * This *will* mean an extra function call per memory interaction but on
 * most systems this is pretty cheap.  It will also mean that this file
 * needs to be compiled into your programs whether or not they use the
 * debug library unless you want to recompile all .c files with
 * -DMALLOC_DEBUG_DISABLE.
 *
 * Please mail me with any reasonable ideas.
